    "Benny's Movie Watchlist is an interactive, database-driven tool for exploring a curated selection of roughly 100–150 films. Inspired by Benny's personal collection of movies stored in a Word document, this project transforms a simple list into a structured database with querying, randomization, and visualization capabilities."
