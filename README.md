| **Shy Adelman**    | Data Visualization & Interface: Create visualizations (genre, decade, director), assist with randomizer logic, and help develop user interface components in Python             |
| **Adonis Fuentes** | Randomizers & Analysis Functions: Build global, genre, and decade randomizers; write analysis functions for films per decade and genre; support schema design and query testing |
| **Benny Candie**   | Data & Validation: Convert Word → TXT → CSV, clean and validate dataset, check duplicates, normalize director and genre labels, and verify all required fields                  |

**Integration:** All team members will collaborate to connect all elements, and the final product will be a running Python script with a UI in which we can search, find, rate, and update the database file based on user input.

## Project Overview

Benny's Movie Watchlist is an interactive, database-driven tool for exploring a curated selection of roughly 100–150 films. Inspired by Benny's personal collection of movies stored in a Word document, this project transforms a simple list into a structured database with querying, randomization, and visualization capabilities.

The project incorporates:

- Structured data modeling
- Data validation and transformation
- Python-based randomization features
- Visual exploration tools (optional, time permitting)
