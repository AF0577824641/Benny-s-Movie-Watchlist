| 1     | Created the database schema                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2     | Created the create_database.py file. I used the database schema as reference as well as the file that was created from the MySQL query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3     | Created the import_data file once the bennie_movie.db file was created. Initially created a python file for each table but instead consolidated into one python file titled 02_import_data.py. After each import it commits to refresh the table then follows through to import the rest of the tables. One note: wasn't sure if adding error messages to this would be beneficial since I was just importing data |
| 4     | Created the 04_random_genre.py file to test the randomization functionality with the current database file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 01 Create Database                  | 3           | When inputting subprocess code, one of the most common errors encountered was indentation. Realized that the libraries had to be added to each of the Python files for them to be run. Noticed that if one global files was created for all the libraires thenn that would make this a bit more complex than needed for this project. |
