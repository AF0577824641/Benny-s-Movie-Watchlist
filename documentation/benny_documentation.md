| 11/10/25, 11/11/25                     | Completed data standardization and validation over the course of two days. Movies, genres, and directors were correctly linked to their respective categories within their own sheets. Additionally, I was able to fix the tables so that multiple directors associated with single films was reflected in a way that program would be able to interpret later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11/25/25, 11/28/25, 11/29/25, 11/30/25 | Set up remote server access to the database. Originally had tried to do this through MySQL but it ended up being too difficult for the stage at which the project was in and too hard to facilitate to the rest of the group as remote connection access required specific IP addresses that would have potentially locked any group mate out of accessing the file when attempting to demonstrate from an unfamiliar IP (such as at school). This was resolved by using myfreesqldatabase and uploading our connected database to that instead. This worked and allows us to connected to it and host it somewhere publicly. There was a lot of trial and error but after being able to complete the set up and coding the connection it does work! |
