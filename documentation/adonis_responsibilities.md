| 1     | Created the database schema                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2     | Created the create_database.py file. I used the database schema as reference as well as the file that was created from the MySQL query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3     | Created the import_data file once the bennie_movie.db file was created. Initially created a python file for each table but instead consolidated into one python file titled 02_import_data.py. After each import it commits to refresh the table then follows through to import the rest of the tables. One note: wasn't sure if adding error messages to this would be beneficial since I was just importing data |
| 4     | Created the 04_random_genre.py file to test the randomization functionality with the current database file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
